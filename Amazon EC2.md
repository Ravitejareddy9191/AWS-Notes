### Amazon EC2
      Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. 

### Steps to use Amazon EC2 
     1. Choosing an AMI 
        → Amazon Machine Image is a template that is used to create a new instance/machine based on user requirement. 
        → The AMI would contain Software Information, Operating System Information, Volume Information, Access    Permissions. 
        → AMI’s are of 2 types 
                  Predefined AMI’s - are created by Amazon and can be modified by the user. 
                  Custom AMI’s - are created by the user so that they can be reused. 
     2. Choosing an Instance Type 
        → An Instance type specifies the hardware specifications that are required in the machine. 
        → These Instances are divided into 5 families 
            Compute Optimized 
                For situations that require a lot of processing power. 
            Memory Optimized 
                For setting up something to do with your in-memory cache. 
            GPU Optimized 
                For setting up a gaming system or something with a large graphical requirement. 
            Storage optimized 
                For setting up a storage server 
            General Purpose 
      3. Configuring Instance 
            You must specify the number of instances, purchasing options, the kind of network, the subnet, when to assign a public IP, the IAM role the shutdown behavior etc. 
      4. Adding Storage 
            You are tasked with deciding the type of storage which could be  
             Ephemeral Storage (Temporary and free) 
             Amazon Elastic Block Storage (permanent and paid) 
             Amazon S3 
      5. Adding Tags 
      6. Configuring Security Groups 
      7. Review
