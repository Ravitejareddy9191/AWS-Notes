## Defination: 
          Amazon EC2 provide on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud.
          Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster.
          An EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud
          When we launch an EC2 Instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance.
          Each Instance type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage resources.
       
                                             -  Compute
                        EC2 Instance         -  Memory
                                             -  Network
                                             -  Storage
### Amazon EC2 Instance types
        1. General Purpose
        2. Compute optimized
        3. Memory optimized
        4. Storage optimized
        5. Accelerated computing
        6. High Performance computing
### Features of Amazon EC2
     1. Instances
           Virtual Servers
     2. Amazon Machine Images(AMIs)
           Preconfigured templates for your instances that packages the components you need for your server(Including the operating system and additional software).
     3. Instance types
           Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances.
     4. Amazon EBS Volumes
           Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store.
     5. Instance store Volumes
           Storage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance.
     6. Keypairs
           Secure login information for your instances. AWS Stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place.
     7. Security Groups
           A virtual firewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges 
           to which your instances can connect.
